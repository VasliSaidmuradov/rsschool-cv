## Summary
In the field of front-end development, relatively recently since March 2019. I studied the basics of frontend on the geekbrains.ru portal in 2018-2019. At first, about 6 months, I made up landing pages. Today I am working on a project where we use vue.js (nuxt.js). Very interested in professional development as a JS developer. In my free time I learn the basics of Java Script (https://frontendmasters.com, https://www.udemy.com) and I also solve basic algorithms using JS code wars (<https://www.codewars.com/users/Vasli>). In work I use https://learn.javascript.ru and https://developer.mozilla.org/en/. I speak English at the basic level (A2), read the documentation.
